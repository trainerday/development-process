# Claude Integration Notes

## Purpose

This document serves as a reference for:
- Claude-specific workflows and processes
- AI-assisted development patterns
- Documentation standards when working with Claude
- Project-specific instructions for Claude

## Getting Started

1. Always specify which project context you're working in
2. Reference existing documentation and patterns
3. Follow established coding and documentation standards

## Notes

*Add your Claude-related notes and workflows here*


## IMPORTANT: Link Format for Obsidian

When creating links in the priority-list to backlogs and tasks, ALWAYS use the actual file title format, NOT the permalink format.

**CORRECT format:**
```
[[Web - Improve UX - Button Consistency|Backlog]] [[Web - Improve UX - Button Consistency - Tasks|Tasks]]
```

**WRONG format (will create new files instead of linking):**
```
[[dev-priorities/backlogs/web-improve-ux-button-consistency|Backlog]] [[dev-priorities/tasks/web-improve-ux-button-consistency-tasks|Tasks]]
```

The link text inside the brackets must match the exact title of the file as it appears in the file system, including proper capitalization and spacing. Using permalink format will cause Obsidian to create duplicate files instead of linking to existing ones.
