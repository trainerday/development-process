# Lightweight Development Process

## Core Cycle
- **Monday**: Demo last week's work, plan this week's priorities
- **Thursday**: Progress check, surface blockers
- **Max task size**: Must be demoable within 1 week

## Backlog Management
- **Product Owner**: Defines features in MD files (what/why/acceptance criteria)
- **Developers**: Break features into weekly tasks in separate task files
- **Priority List**: Simple list of next 10-15 backlog items for developers

## Task Flow
1. Developer picks next priority from list
2. Breaks into weekly tasks (with LLM help)
3. Creates GitHub issue for current task
4. Works async, updates on blockers
5. Demos progress Monday

## Tools
- **Obsidian**: Backlog planning and strategic kanbans (PO only)
- **GitHub Issues**: Active work tracking (single board, all projects)
- **Priority List**: Bridge between planning and execution
- **LLMs**: Better task definitions and breakdowns

## Key Rules
- One task per developer per week
- If stuck >2 days, break down further
- Cross-project work clearly labeled
- Demo something working every Monday
