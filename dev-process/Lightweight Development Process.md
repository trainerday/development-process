# Lightweight Development Process

## Improvement Goals
- Improve the quality of task/pr descriptions and general process of github
- Get developers more involved in the design process
- Determine ways that each person can work with Claude / AI to optimize their workflows
- Reduce work in progress (WIP) and make it transparent what each person gets done each week


## Core Cycle
- **Monday**: Demo last week's work, plan this week's priorities
- **Thursday**: Progress check, surface blockers
- **Max task size**: Must be demoable within 1 week

## Backlog Management
- **Product Owner**: Defines features in MD files (what/why/acceptance criteria)
- **Developers**: Break features into weekly tasks in separate task files
- **Priority List**: Simple list of next 10-15 backlog items for developers

## Task Flow
1. Developer picks next priority from list
2. Breaks into weekly tasks (with LLM help)
3. Creates GitHub issue for current task
4. Works async, updates on blockers
5. Demos progress Monday

## Tools
- **Obsidian**: Backlog planning (Alex)
- **GitHub Issues**: Active work tracking (single board, all projects)
- **Priority List**: Bridge between planning and execution
- **LLMs**: Better task definitions and breakdowns

## Key Rules
- One task per developer per week
- If stuck >2 days, break down further
- Cross-project work clearly labeled
- Demo something working every Monday
