If someone says backlog, look
1) At the contents in this file dev-priorities/priority-list
2) At everything in this folder dev-priorities/backlogs


Creating new backlog and tasks

If someone says create a backlog. It either means link to from existing item inside the dev-priorities/priority-list note to a new note in the dev-priorities/backlogs with a correct permalink.  That link should be titled [[Backlog]]  and put at the end of the current item in the list.  Make sure this is just an empty file.  Don't add anything extra

Also when creating a new backlog in the backlogs folder, also create a task in the tasks folder (dev-priorities/tasks) and put a link to that tasks on the priority with the name [[Tasks]].    When creating the task use this template dev-process/templates/task-template.  Do not add anything extra.  Just put what is there other than the link to the backlog and setting the correct permalinks.

If someone asks you to create a issue in github, use GH and copy the information from the task to the issue and put the issue on the project board located here https://github.com/orgs/trainerday/projects/1
