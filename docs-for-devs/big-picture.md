# Developer Big Picture - Company Priorities

*Last Updated: July 14, 2025*

### Why the below priorities? 


**This reframing is powerful: This is what Claude Said**

- You don't have a product quality problem (4.7 stars!)
- You don't have a support burden (10 tickets/week)
- You have a **value communication problem**

So we don't have a "product problem," per-se.  We have to fine tune, optimize and communicate our value better.  Get them seeing the value faster.  We have known this but now we have the tools and date to prioritize this.


## Company-Level Priorities (In Order)

### 1. ðŸŽ¯ PRIMARY: Convert More Free Users to Paid
**The Core Business Opportunity**: Significant monthly registrations but only ~24% convert to paid. Improving to 30% conversion = massive annual revenue increase in pure profit.

**Why This is #1**: 
- Product quality is proven (4.7 stars, minimal support tickets)
- We don't have a product problem - we have a conversion problem
- Highest ROI opportunity (pure profit, no additional marketing cost)

### 2. ðŸš€ SECONDARY: Reduce Registration Abandonment  
**The Funnel Opportunity**: 37.6% of app downloads don't complete registration. Even capturing a portion could feed more users into the conversion funnel.

### 3. ðŸ“ˆ TERTIARY: Optimize Overall Growth Engine
**The Long-term Play**: Improve web conversion, retention, and organic growth channels.

## Conversion Problem #1: Free â†’ Paid (PRIMARY FOCUS)

### What We Know:
- Significant monthly registrations across platforms
- ~24% overall conversion rate to paid
- 5 different user personas with different needs
- Platform expectation mismatch (app vs web)
- 90% of cancellations are positive ("I'll be back")

### The Math:
Current: 24% conversion  
Goal: 30% conversion  
Impact: Massive annual revenue increase in pure profit

### What We Need to Decide:
**MISSING CRITICAL DATA** - We need converter vs non-converter behavior analysis to know:
1. Which of the 5 personas convert best?
2. What do converters do in first session vs non-converters?
3. Where exactly do users drop off?
4. Do web vs app registrants convert differently?
5. How many actually reach the paywall vs abandon before?

### Potential Solutions (Pending Data):
- Persona-specific onboarding
- First session experience optimization
- Platform expectation setting
- Free tier optimization
- Progress feedback system

---

## Conversion Problem #2: Download â†’ Registration (SECONDARY)

### What We Know:
- 37.6% of app downloads don't complete registration  
- ~50% of abandoners are likely returning users who just login
- Of remaining new users, ~50% probably wouldn't use app anyway
- **True opportunity**: ~9% of downloads (genuinely interested new users)
- At realistic 20% conversion: substantial new customers annually

### The Decision Point:
**Is development effort worth the revenue opportunity?**
- Revenue potential: Significant annual recurring revenue
- Plus differentiation benefit ("the app you can actually try")
- Plus better user experience and word-of-mouth

### Current Solution Design:
- "Skip for now" option with clear messaging
- "Start Training in Seconds" + "20 free structured workouts"  
- Social proof: "Join 20,000+ cyclists"
- Trust building: "The free version is great!!!"

### What We Need to Decide:
**MISSING IMPLEMENTATION DECISION** - Is this worth the development effort given:
1. Technical complexity of "try before register"
2. Other priorities competing for dev time
3. Actual revenue opportunity vs estimates

---

## Conversion Problem #3: Web Traffic â†’ Registration (TERTIARY)

### What We Know:
- Significant annual web visitors
- 3.8% registration rate (better than expected)
- Many pre-sold from Reddit/YouTube but still don't convert

### What We Need to Decide:
**MISSING ANALYSIS** - Should we optimize web conversion or focus on app-first strategy?

---

## Technical Priorities by Business Impact

### Tier 1: Must Analyze Before Deciding
1. **Converter behavior analysis** - Critical data for Freeâ†’Paid optimization
2. **Registration abandonment ROI calculation** - Is development worth it?

### Tier 2: High-Impact (Pending Tier 1 Results)
1. **First-time user experience optimization** - Based on converter data
2. **Platform expectation management** - Reduce appâ†’web friction
3. **Registration flow improvement** - If ROI justifies development

### Tier 3: Supporting Improvements
1. **Progress feedback system** - User retention and motivation
2. **Bluetooth reliability** - Core functionality
3. **General UX simplification** - Reduce cognitive load

---

## What's Blocking Final Decisions

### For Freeâ†’Paid Priority:
- **Need**: Behavioral analysis of converters vs non-converters
- **Timeline**: Should be completed before major development decisions
- **Impact**: Will determine which personas to optimize for and how

### For Registration Abandonment:
- **Need**: Technical feasibility assessment + accurate ROI calculation
- **Questions**: Development effort, revenue opportunity, resource allocation
- **Impact**: Determines if this gets prioritized over other initiatives

### For Overall Strategy:
- **Need**: Clear resource allocation between app-first vs web optimization
- **Context**: Limited development resources require focus decisions

---

## Success Metrics to Track
- **Primary**: Free user â†’ Paid conversion rate (goal: 24% â†’ 30%)
- **Secondary**: App download â†’ Registration rate (baseline: 62.4%)
- **Supporting**: Web visitor â†’ Registration rate (baseline: 3.8%)
- **Quality**: Maintain 4.7 star rating and low support volume

## The Bottom Line
**We have a great product with a conversion problem, not a quality problem.** The massive opportunity is in Freeâ†’Paid conversion, but we need data analysis to know exactly where to focus development effort for maximum business impact.

## Conversion Problem #2: Download â†’ Registration (SECONDARY)
## THE #1 PRIORITY: Convert More Free Users to Paid

**The Opportunity**: We have proven numbers showing significant drop-off at forced registration, plus strong organic growth from word-of-mouth. The app has 4.7 stars and minimal support tickets - **the product works great for those who try it**.

## Key Metrics - App Conversion Funnel

### Hard Numbers (Annual):
- **App Downloads**: Significant volume across iOS and Android
- **App Registrations**: Majority of downloads do register
- **Download â†’ Registration Rate**: 62.4%
- **Abandonment at Forced Registration**: 37.6%

### The Reality Check:
- 37% don't register
- ~50% of those are returning users who just login
- Of the remaining ~18.5% who are new: 50% wouldn't use app anyway
- **True abandoners**: ~9.25% of downloads

### Realistic Impact:
- Many people who are interested but won't register first
- At 20% conversion rate: significant new customers/year
- **Revenue opportunity**: Substantial annual recurring revenue

### Is It Worth It?
- Development effort vs significant recurring revenue
- Plus differentiation benefit ("the app you can actually try")
- Plus positive word-of-mouth from better experience

## Primary Business Objective
**Make more profit** - The fastest path is reducing friction for pre-sold customers who come from Reddit, YouTube comparisons, and word-of-mouth.

## Top Priority Issues

### 1. ðŸš¨ First-Time User Experience (ALIGNS WITH PRIMARY BUSINESS GOAL)
- **Problem**: 37.6% of app downloads don't register
- **Reality Check**: Unknown % are returning users, but even 50% new users = huge opportunity (18% of users don't register if this is true)
- **Solution**: "Try before register" could be major differentiator
- **Industry Context**: Competitors force registration too, but TD as lesser-known brand needs to prove value first
- 
See the "Skip for now" will be the complicated part.  We can decide, maybe for now they can just look around but to save a workout they need an account. So we show a popup when they click skip and put a register login message in the app.

### 2. ðŸš¨ First-Time User Experience
- **Problem**: New users face learning curve (FTP, blue bars, numbers)
- **Reality**: 80-90% of users know this from other apps
- **Focus**: Optimize for experienced users first, beginners second

### 3. ðŸš¨ Web Visitor Conversion
- **Web traffic**: Significant annual visitors
- **Registration rate**: 3.8%
- **Reality**: Better than expected, but still room for improvement
- **Context**: Many are pre-sold from Reddit/YouTube but still don't convert

## What We Know Works
- **Organic Growth**: Reddit, YouTube comparisons, word-of-mouth
- **Product Quality**: 4.7 stars, 90% positive cancellations
- **Price Point**: Affordable alternative to TrainerRoad/Zwift
- **User Base**: Strong paying user base, 30% growth last winter

## Critical Success Factors
1. **Remove friction for pre-sold users** - They come ready to buy but hit barriers
2. **Differentiate through experience** - Let users try before competitors force registration
3. **Focus on experienced cyclists** - They're 80-90% of user base and easier to convert
4. **Trust the organic growth** - Word-of-mouth is working, just remove barriers

## Development Priorities
1. **Test removing forced registration** - Biggest bang for buck
2. **Optimize first workout experience** - Clear value in 5 minutes
3. **Clarify web messaging** - For those who don't go app-first
4. **Price parity** - Already addressing app vs web pricing

## The Bottom Line
We have great organic traffic from trusted sources (Reddit, YouTube, word-of-mouth). These pre-sold users should convert at 40-50%, not at current rates. Removing forced registration could be the key to unlocking this value.

### What We Know:
- 37.6% of app downloads don't complete registration  
- ~50% of abandoners are likely returning users who just login
- Of remaining new users, ~50% probably wouldn't use app anyway
- **True opportunity**: ~9% of downloads (genuinely interested new users)
- At realistic 20% conversion: substantial new customers annually

### The Decision Point:
**Is development effort worth the revenue opportunity?**
- Revenue potential: Significant annual recurring revenue
- Plus differentiation benefit ("the app you can actually try")
- Plus better user experience and word-of-mouth

### Current Solution Design:
- "Skip for now" option with clear messaging
- "Start Training in Seconds" + "20 free structured workouts"  
- Social proof: "Join 20,000+ cyclists"

1. Technical complexity of "try before register"
2. Other priorities competing for dev time
3. Actual revenue opportunity vs estimates
