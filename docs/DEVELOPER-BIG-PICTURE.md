# Developer Big Picture - Updated

*Last Updated: July 14, 2025*

## THE #1 PRIORITY: Convert More Free Users to Paid

**The Opportunity**: We have proven numbers showing significant drop-off at forced registration, plus strong organic growth from word-of-mouth. The app has 4.7 stars and minimal support tickets - **the product works great for those who try it**.

## Key Metrics - App Conversion Funnel

### Hard Numbers (Annual):
- **App Downloads**: Significant volume across iOS and Android
- **App Registrations**: Majority of downloads do register
- **Download â†’ Registration Rate**: 62.4%
- **Abandonment at Forced Registration**: 37.6%

### The Reality Check:
- 37% don't register
- ~50% of those are returning users who just login
- Of the remaining ~18.5% who are new: 50% wouldn't use app anyway
- **True abandoners**: ~9.25% of downloads

### Realistic Impact:
- Many people who are interested but won't register first
- At 20% conversion rate: significant new customers/year
- **Revenue opportunity**: Substantial annual recurring revenue

### Is It Worth It?
- Development effort vs significant recurring revenue
- Plus differentiation benefit ("the app you can actually try")
- Plus positive word-of-mouth from better experience

## Primary Business Objective
**Make more profit** - The fastest path is reducing friction for pre-sold customers who come from Reddit, YouTube comparisons, and word-of-mouth.

## Top Priority Issues

### 1. ðŸš¨ Forced Registration in Apps (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
- **Problem**: 37.6% of app downloads don't complete registration
- **Reality Check**: Unknown % are returning users, but even 50% new users = huge opportunity
- **Solution**: "Try before register" could be major differentiator
- **Industry Context**: Competitors force registration too, but TD as lesser-known brand needs to prove value first
- 
The Skip For now is the complicated part

### 2. ðŸš¨ First-Time User Experience
- **Problem**: New users face learning curve (FTP, blue bars, numbers)
- **Reality**: 80-90% of users know this from other apps
- **Focus**: Optimize for experienced users first, beginners second

### 3. ðŸš¨ Web Visitor Conversion
- **Web traffic**: Significant annual visitors
- **Registration rate**: 3.8%
- **Reality**: Better than expected, but still room for improvement
- **Context**: Many are pre-sold from Reddit/YouTube but still don't convert

## What We Know Works
- **Organic Growth**: Reddit, YouTube comparisons, word-of-mouth
- **Product Quality**: 4.7 stars, 90% positive cancellations
- **Price Point**: Affordable alternative to TrainerRoad/Zwift
- **User Base**: Strong paying user base, 30% growth last winter

## Critical Success Factors
1. **Remove friction for pre-sold users** - They come ready to buy but hit barriers
2. **Differentiate through experience** - Let users try before competitors force registration
3. **Focus on experienced cyclists** - They're 80-90% of user base and easier to convert
4. **Trust the organic growth** - Word-of-mouth is working, just remove barriers

## Development Priorities
1. **Test removing forced registration** - Biggest bang for buck
2. **Optimize first workout experience** - Clear value in 5 minutes
3. **Clarify web messaging** - For those who don't go app-first
4. **Price parity** - Already addressing app vs web pricing

## The Bottom Line
We have great organic traffic from trusted sources (Reddit, YouTube, word-of-mouth). These pre-sold users should convert at 40-50%, not at current rates. Removing forced registration could be the key to unlocking this value.
